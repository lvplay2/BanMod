<h3 id="information">INFORMATION</h3>
<p>BanMod was created mainly because AmongUs has become a place full of rude players</p>
<p>and/or players who team up ruining the gaming experience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the simple ban of Among</p>
<p>is circumvented by changing the ip of the device or using a vpn!!!</p>
